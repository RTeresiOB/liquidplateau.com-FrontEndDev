          <p> Welcome to my personal website, where I will keep an updated accounting of what I've done,
           what I'm working on, and where I'm headed next. Because  what I'm working on is always evolving and changing, this website will be a living document. Make sure to check back in for new content, projects, and features!
        </p>
        <p>
        My name is Robert Teresi and 
        I am a data-intensive research associate at the Yale School of Management, working in the Organizational Behavior group. 
          In my role, I have had the privilege of pursuing my interests in empirical research, social sciences, and data science to 
          answer new questions about human relationships and organizations on micro- and macro scales. If you click the research projects tab, I have listed some of the research I have been involved with in a significant way.
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm driven by using data to learn more about the world, and I'm always learning more about ways to drive deeper insights. Recently, I've been interested in applications for sparse/high-dimensional matrices - SVD/PCA, factorization machines, and embedding techniques more generally.

              <li>Sent surveys 15 minutes before the end of staff and faculty shifts during the peak of the first wave of the COVID pandemic to help understand and prevent sources of stress and burnout among physicians, residents, APPs, and nurses. </li>

            <li>Improved performance of an existing logistic LASSO classifier algorithm, training the algorithm to learn the characteristics of 2 distinct types of rhetoric: the “fairness case” for diversity (e.g., “diversity at work is the right thing to do”) and the “business case” for diversity (e.g., “diversity at work is good for business”).</li>
            <li> Used the trained classifier to run out-of-sample predictions on whether Fortune 500 companies’ online diversity statements corresponded to a “fairness” case or a “business case”, with the goal of investigating the current prevalence of these two diversity narratives in organizations.</li>

            <p>On my contact page, you will find links to my socials and my email address.</p>
            <p>On the twitter ideology page, you can find a dashboard I created for one of my active research projects (more info in my projects page and the dashboard page itself).
               The dashboard was written with d3.js, optimizing the library for use with React by creating cross-graph reactivity and reusable, dynamic graph components.</p>
               <p>
               The backend of the dashboard delivers results from a sci-kit learn machine learning pipeline via a Python Flask app. If you enter in a public twitter user's username, they will be looked up using the Twitter API and scored by the model in real time if they are a valid account. </p>
